# CRUD Interface
## Rails with a React front-end

Following [this][1] guide.

Each commit will mark my progress from one `<h4>` or `<h2>` element to the next.

## Notes
I encountered [this][2] error after I completed my first, "[Adding a new item][3]," commit.

I ask and answer this issue on StackOverflow [here][4].

I also ran into the following error after completing the, "Deleting an item," commit:

>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound (Couldn't find Item with 'id'=${id}):

and the following error in the console:

>jquery.self-bd7ddd3â€¦.js?body=1:10255 DELETE http://localhost:3000 ... 404 (Not Found)

Which were solved using one of the comments found below the article [here][5].
